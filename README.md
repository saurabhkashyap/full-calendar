## Installation

Use your preferred package manager to install the calendar component directly from the custom ShadCN UI registry:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add "https://calendar.jeraidi.dev/r/full-calendar.json"
```

## Usage

Import and use the `Calendar` component in your page:

```tsx
import React, { Suspense } from "react";
import { Calendar } from "@/features/calendar/calendar";
import { CalendarSkeleton } from "@/features/calendar/skeletons/calendar-skeleton";

export default function CalendarPage() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<CalendarSkeleton />}>
      <Calendar />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

## Project Structure

Here's an overview of the important files and directories in the project:

```

├── modules/
│   └── components/
│       └── calendar/
│           ├── calendar.tsx          # Main entry point component. Fetches data and wraps the app in providers.
│           ├── contexts/
│           │   ├── calendar-context.tsx  # Core state management (events, users, view state, filters).
│           │   └── dnd-context.tsx       # Drag-and-drop context provider.
│           ├── header/
│           │   └── calendar-header.tsx   # Top navigation bar (view switcher, date nav, filters).
│           ├── views/                    # Contains specific view components (Day, Week, Month, Year, Agenda).
│           ├── calendar-body.tsx         # Renders the active view based on current state.
│           ├── helpers.ts                # Core utility functions for date manipulation and calendar logic.
│           ├── hooks.ts                  # Custom hooks for calendar logic.
│           └── types.ts                  # TypeScript definitions for events, users, and views.
```

## How It Works

The project is architected around a central context provider that manages the state of the calendar. Here is the high-level flow:

1.  **Initialization**:

    - The `Calendar` component (`src/components/calendar/calendar.tsx`) serves as the entry point.
    - It fetches initial data (events and users) and initializes the `CalendarProvider`.

2.  **State Management**:

    - `CalendarContext` holds the application state, including the current view (Day, Week, Month, etc.), selected date, list of events, and active filters.
    - It uses `localStorage` to persist user preferences such as the preferred view, time format (12h/24h), and badge styles.

3.  **Rendering Logic**:

    - The `CalendarHeader` allows users to navigate dates, switch views, and apply filters.
    - The `CalendarBody` listens to the `view` state from the context and dynamically renders the appropriate view component (e.g., `MonthView`, `WeekView`).

4.  **Interactions**:
    - **Drag & Drop**: The `DndProvider` wraps the calendar to enable drag-and-drop functionality for events. When an event is moved, the context updates the event's start and end times.
    - **Event Management**: Functions like `addEvent`, `updateEvent`, and `removeEvent` in the context handle CRUD operations, ensuring the UI stays in sync with the data.
